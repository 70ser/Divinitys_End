                Divinity's End 1.1.6, for Minecraft 1.19.2
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Length:     15-35 hours
Objectives: 13 + 16 bonus
Difficulty: Medium

The map is fully compatible with multiplayer, just make sure to use a vanilla
(NOT: Spigot, Paper, Forge...) server.

While it's not recommended to use mods, Optifine or Sodium+Phosphor improve
performance and don't seem to cause major issues as of writing this.
